<b>Disclaimer: </b> Just a friendly reminder to please note this project is still under continouus and heavy development, which means things may break or change from time to time.  But that doesn't mean we want it to break! So we ask if you do encounter any issues, to please file them and one of us will try to respond as quickly as possible. Additionally, not all security features are currently enabled, such as hardware encryption or secure boot; without these features, private keys can be extracted with physical access to the device.
