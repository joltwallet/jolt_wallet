 * Since the GUI callbacks must respond as quickly as possible, longer running 
 * actions are packaged up as jobs and send to the BG task to be executed.
 * Within JoltOS, some examples of this are:
 *     * Mnemonic master seed derivation
 *     * HTTP Actions
 *     * Processing CLI commands
 *
 * If a screen is provided, the following will be performed:
 *     1. The screen's back action will be overrided to send a JOLT_BG_ABORT signal to the task.
 * Typically some form of loading screen is used.
 * If your task needs to be passed a screen, but you don't want these actions,
 * pass the screen as part of param.

 * Upon task completion, the Job will clean up itself.
