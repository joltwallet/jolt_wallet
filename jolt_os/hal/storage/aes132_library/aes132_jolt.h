 * The primary goal of this function is to get the ATAES132a into a useable state 
 * for Jolt.
 *
 * This includes:
 *     1. Generating a Master Key using the ESP32 onboard entropy. This key is 
 *        used to change keys to storage zones. The security of the Master Key 
 *        isn't critical to the security of the mnemonic; it is assumed that an
 *        attacker has access to the master key. Master Key isn't fixed just 
 *        to be a little more difficult.
 *     2. Store the Master Key both locally, and back it up to the ATAES132a chip.
 *     3. Configure and Lock the ATAES132a. This activates the cryptographically
 *        secure RNG generator.
 *
 * At the end of this function, ATAES132a is ready to go and Master Key is in RAM.
